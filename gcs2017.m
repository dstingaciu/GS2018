function varargout = gcs2017(varargin)
% GCS2017 MATLAB code for gcs2017.fig
%      GCS2017, by itself, creates a new GCS2017 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%      H = GCS2017 returns the handle to a new GCS2017 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      GCS2017('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in GCS2017.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      GCS2017('Property','Value',...) creates a new GCS2017 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before gcs2017_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to gcs2017_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
